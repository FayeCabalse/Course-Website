The CSS1 language is human readable and writable, and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology. One of the fundamental features of CSS is that style sheets cascade; authors can attach a preferred style sheet, while the reader may have a personal style sheet to adjust for human or technological handicaps. The rules for resolving conflicts between different style sheets are defined in this specification.</p>

                                    <p class="CSS">CSS2 came out in 1998, and contained a lot of the features that designers had been longing for. Boxes could be made to behave like HTML table cells, or they could be positioned in different ways; more powerful selectors were available; style sheets could be imported into other style sheets; style rules could be specific to certain output media; and so on. Vast improvements had also been made in the areas of paged media (printing), and the generation of content from the style sheet.</p>

Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.</p>
